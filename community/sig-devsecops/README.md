# DevSecOps Special Interest Group

This SIG covers all the tools and supporting container images that deliver Thoth-Station applications, as well as the build pipelines and Continuous Integration systems that enable the automated builds.
This includes the discussion related to the release process of the Thoth-Station applications, the build pipelines themselves, supporting container images, tooling, and architectural decisions.

The [charter](charter.md) defines the scope and governance of the DevSecOps Special Interest Group.
